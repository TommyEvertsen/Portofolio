              I completed a professional front-end development program at the University of California, which consisted
              of five courses, each with a duration of three months. This comprehensive program provided me with a deep
              understanding of the logical aspects of programming and the principles of designing user-friendly web
              pages. It also emphasized accessibility, teaching us how to create web content that is accessible to
              individuals with visual impairments and other disabilities.

            <p style="font-size: large; line-height: 2em">
              Throughout the program, students collaborated in teams to simulate real-world working environments. We
              collectively developed web pages, supported each other, and brainstormed ideas for mutual improvement. The
              instructors were exceptionally helpful, offering their expertise to assist us with our projects. We
              engaged in discussions about our code, addressing challenges we encountered, and received valuable tips
              for writing more efficient code.

              I thoroughly enjoyed this program and highly recommend it to anyone interested in programming and web
              design.
